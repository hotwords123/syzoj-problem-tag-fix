# syzoj-problem-tag-fix

A simple syzoj problem tags crawler - fix the problems which have their tags missing!

## How to use

Remove all `-example` in the filenames. Then modify them according to your needs.

Run `node app` to start the crawler. This program will output the sql commands to add the tags.

To clear all caches, delete the files with names starting with `cache-` in this directory.

P.S. Unlike many other Online Judges, [syzoj](https://github.com/syzoj/syzoj) is really crawler-friendly. It doesn't take much effort to do this :)
